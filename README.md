# Air Toxicity Prediction

This project aims to predict air toxicity levels in Mumbai, India, focusing on pollutant concentrations at three locations: Chakala, Kurla, and the Airport. The goal is to find the best algorithm for pollutant data using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, LSTM, and XGBoost. Predictions from each model are compared using RMSE.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders: `data` and `notebook`.

### Data

The `data` folder contains two subfolders: `raw_data` and `processed_data`.

- `raw_data`: Contains the raw pollutant concentration data for the three locations in Mumbai.
- `processed_data`: Contains the preprocessed data, ready for analysis and modeling.

### Notebook

The `notebook` folder contains Python notebooks organized into four subfolders: `EDA`, `Prediction`, `Forecast`, and a temporary/dump folder.

- `EDA`: Contains notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- `Prediction`: Contains notebooks for building and evaluating prediction models using various machine learning algorithms.
- `Forecast`: Contains notebooks for forecasting pollutant concentrations.
- `temp/dump`: A temporary folder for storing miscellaneous files and work-in-progress notebooks.
